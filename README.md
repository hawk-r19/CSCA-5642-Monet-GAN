# CSCA 5642 Week 5 Generative Adversarial Project  

This project is a submission to [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started), as a brief project to learn about GANs.

## Files

- monet_v3.ipynb
  - the main notebook that includes the entire modelling process and analysis

### Note:  
> *The data is downloaded from the Kaggle competition website, and is extracted to a folder named 'data' within the root directory. This is how the files are referenced in the main notebook. I did not include them in this repo due to their size.*
